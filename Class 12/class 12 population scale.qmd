Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
pop <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(pop)
```
```{r}
nrow(pop)
```

```{r}
table(pop$geno)
```

108 have the A/A genotype, 233 have A/G, and 121 have G/G.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
pop %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  summarize(avg_exp = mean(exp))
```
The average expression of the A/A genotype is 31.82, A/G genotype is 25.40, and G/G is 20.60.

Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(pop) + aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

It appears that the G/G SNP decreases expression of the gene.
